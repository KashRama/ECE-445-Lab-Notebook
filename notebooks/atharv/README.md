# Atharv's Notebook for ECE 445

# 08/22 - First Class Meeting

Today we had our first meeting in which we learned about conflict management and mathod's of brainstorming. These skills are extremely important for the class as the class is structured to be a group project. Additionally, we the method's of brainstorming section was helpful in learning about how to think of project ideas that we wanted to work on during the semester. 

# 08/24 - Initial Web Board Post

Today I submitted my initial web board post consisting of an initial project to create a tennis speed and spin detector that would be used by tennis players to identify areas of their game that they can improve.

# 08/31 - Project Submission

Today our group met for the first time to brainstorm a potential project we could work on throughout the semester. The idea we came up with was an automatic rotating bookshelf that could store items like books, backpacks, clothes, etc. The shelf would have 4 compartments with 4 LEDs that would turn on where an item has been found. A mobile application will be used to insert and retrieve itmes on the bookshelf. Here is an image of what we propose our shelf will look like:

# 09/01 - Project Design Brainstorming Session

Today we met with our group to identify what components our bookshelf will have. We came up with the following:

- An iPhone application will be used to control the bookshelf's movements by being able to find and retreive items
- An insertion detection system will be created using a photoresistor or QR code to notify the application when an item has been inserted
- An LED will turn on where the item has been found to indicate that the item has been located
- A motor will be used to rotate the bookshelf when commanded by the application
- A wall outlet will be used to power our bookshelf along with the circuit

# 09/05 - Responsibilities Diveded Amongst Team Members

Today we met with our group to identify where each of our skills will be best utilized. The following is a breakdown of how we will distribute our responsibilities:

- Kashyap will oversee the software aspects, including the connection of the application to the ESP32
- Vraj will oversee the PCB design and motor control
- Atharb will oversee mechanical design and help out with PCB related tasks

# 09/12 - First Team Meeting with TA

Today we met with our TA, Nikhil, for the first time to go over our project and determine what components we will use to complete our bookshelf. The following are the main takeaways that came from the meeting:

- An ESP32 with WiFi/Bluetooth capabilities will be used to connect the bookshelf hardware to the application
- The power for our bookshelf and circuit will come from a wall outlet
- A stepper motor will be used to rotate our bookshelf as it is best to control how much the bookshelf will spin rotate when turning. This is an image of what the motor will look like:

# 09/14 - Project Proposal Working Session

Today we met with our group to work on the project proposal. These are the main takeaways we had from the meeting:

- The bookshelf will be 4ft tall and 2 ft wide with a cylindrical shape
- Each shelf will have 4 horizontal shelves to separate items further
- A QR code will be used to determine which shelf the user is inputting items to

# 09/15 - Initial Conversation with the Machine Shop

Today we met with the machine shop to go over what we want our bookshelf to look like. Through this conversation, we made a few changes to our design. These are the updates we came up with:

- We are scaling the bookshelf down to be 8in x 8in, and hold electrical components like capacitors and resistors to make it more compact and easier to transfer
- There will be a 10in x 10in x 10in box underneath the shelf to store the PCB, LED, and motor
- We will have holes on the bottom of each shelf that will go directly over the LED to show if/when an item has been found on the shelf
- We also received a stepper motor that will be used for our bookshelf

# 09/16 - CAD Design

After our conversation with the machine shop, we created a CAD design to model what our shelf will look like for the machine shop to use.

# 10/06 - Parts Order Day 1

Today we met to identify what parts we need to order from digikey for our PCB. Unfortunately, we had a lot of questions on where to find things so we had to send an email to Nikhil regarding the questions we had. 

<img width="1424" alt="image" src="https://github.com/KashRama/ECE-445-Lab-Notebook/assets/73131848/c4c35994-1ebf-439c-88c5-ddf9b796cf99">

# 10/08 - Parts Order Day 2

Today we received an email from Nikhil answering the questions we had about how and where to order the parts.

<img width="1413" alt="image" src="https://github.com/KashRama/ECE-445-Lab-Notebook/assets/73131848/4b1535c3-1bdc-459a-a440-4a94bf27a04f">

Once we received the email from Nikhil, we identified which parts we needed and where we were able to get each from. We created a spreadsheet with the parts we need, and where we would be able to find those specific parts.

# 10/12 - Submitted CAD Design to Machine Shop

Today we went into the machine sho with the CAD design we had created for what we wanted our bookshelf to look like. Going in with a CAD design was very helpful for them and us as both parties were on the same page regarding what the bookshelf should look like and what the dimensions would be as well. Following the meeting with the machine shop, I sent them an email detailing what we had discussed.

# 10/17 - PCB Order Submitted

Today we submitted our PCB order on PCBWay after designing our circuit and PCB.

# 10/18 - Parts Order

Today we submitted our first parts order off Digikey so we can hopefully get them when the PCB we ordered yesterday arrives. Once we receive both, we plan to begin soldering our PCB.

# 11/01 - Machine Shop Completed Bookshelf

Today we got an email from the machine shop saying that our bookshelf is ready to be picked up. This was exciting for us because it was the first time we were seeing our design come to life. Here is an image of what it looks like:

<img width="196" alt="image" src="https://github.com/KashRama/ECE-445-Lab-Notebook/assets/73131848/987fe382-606d-483e-9313-2fd24c882bc8">

The top compartment had 4 different shelves that can be used to store electrical components. The bottom box has ample space for us to place our circuitry and motor in order to maintain professional packaging. One change we had them made after we saw the bookshelf in real life was adding a stand in the base for the PCB. This was done so that once we had finished our PCB, we'd have a secure spot to place it so that it wouldn't move around and risk breaking.

# 11/03 - Soldering Session 1

Today was the first day we went into the lab to start soldering our PCB. We initially started by trying to get our power subsystem soldered on. This was the circuit on the PCB we were trying to get working during this session:

<img width="453" alt="image" src="https://github.com/KashRama/ECE-445-Lab-Notebook/assets/73131848/b8426bef-ea90-450d-8c86-d694dcef9182">

During this session, we were able to get all the necessary parts soldered on, however, we realized that our circuit was getting shorted somewhere, possibly due to poor soldering done on our end due to extremely small parts. We ended the session there and decided to come in a different day to try and get it working.

# 11/07 - Soldering Session 2

Today we tried fixing the power subsystem issue we were facing in the last session, where there was a short happening somewhere. We tried resoldering everything onto a different PCB, but were still getting the issue of the short. After working for a solid amount of time, we realized that we may be getting this issue because we were trying to hand solder extremely small pieces. We decided to come back the next day and try using the oven.

# 11/08 - Soldering Session 3

Today we tried using the oven to solder all of our small components and the ESP32 onto the new breadboard. These are the components we tried using the paste and oven in order to solder:

<img width="85" alt="image" src="https://github.com/KashRama/ECE-445-Lab-Notebook/assets/73131848/f1ee4a7b-31ce-4e65-b047-200cd634328e">

<img width="249" alt="image" src="https://github.com/KashRama/ECE-445-Lab-Notebook/assets/73131848/2efde574-c488-4d2e-900a-99de32e4c42c">

<img width="103" alt="image" src="https://github.com/KashRama/ECE-445-Lab-Notebook/assets/73131848/79aab9d2-bad2-4da6-a385-a12a26ce7c11">

Using the syringe, we tried to carefully put on the solder paste across these extremely small pins as we unfortunately didn't order a stencil. This was very tedious and we ended up not getting it to work again, due to shorts happening again most likely as a result of overlapping solder. Here is an image of me trying to use the syringe to get the solder paste on. 

<img width="424" alt="image" src="https://github.com/KashRama/ECE-445-Lab-Notebook/assets/73131848/9ea71baf-dd05-4bed-85db-ab258b152ecf">

# 11/12 - Soldering Session 4

Today we had another soldering session where we tried to hand solder the ESP32 on to a completely different board. We did this under a microscope this time in order to make sure we weren't overlapping solder between pins and there were no shorts happening anywhere. This resulted in our ESP32 being successfully programmed when giving it a direct 3.3V supply. During our mock demo, we planned to show the ESP32 programming with the direct 3.3V supply, however, we still new that we had to get our power subsystem working as well.

# 11/14 - Soldering Session 5

Today we went into the lab to try soldering our power subsystem. We faced the same issue again with a short happening somewhere, due to the voltage regulator we were using being extremely small.

# 11/16 - PCB Redesign

Today we decided that we would completely redesign our PCB and order it over break on our own. This was because we thought it would be easier to solder a PCB if the components we were soldering on were bigger. We decided that this would be the best move going forward instead of trying to solder on microscopic parts by hand, as we weren't getting any success.

# 11/18 - Final PCB Order Submitted

Today we submitted our final PCB order on our own. This is because our initial design had many small components that were extremely difficult to solder onto our board. We are hopeful that this is the PCB that will end up working as we spent a lot of time into trying to make the previous PCB to work.

# 11/28 - Soldering Session 6

Today we received the new PCB we ordered over break. We decided to go into the lab all day and try to get the entire PCB soldered on and working. We got our ESP32 programming, along with our new power subsystem with the bigger regulator, however once we put in our H-Bridge circuit, our ESP32 burnt out for some reason and stopped programming. We spent the entire day trying to fix the issue before our demo on 11/29. 

# 11/29 - Final Demo Day

We went into the lab really early in the day to try getting our PCB working again. However, we kept running into issues with it not getting programmed despite multiple soldering attmepts. At this point, we decided to use a breadboard for our final demo, as we'd be able to show a functional project. We were able to get our breadboard working which allowed us to meet all our high level requirements that we had set at the beginning of the project. Our demo went successfully, and we were happy to hear the Professor Shao would allow us to try getting our PCB to work for the final presentation to receive those points.

# 12/04 - Project Complete

After a long semester, we finally completed our project. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get it working completely on the PCB, but were able to get it fully functioning with the breadboard. We almost had our PCB working, however as we were about to take our video, the power regulator blew up and the PCB didn't work. We learned that in the future, we would ensure all calculations are done correctly so that none of our components would blow up. Despite all the challenges, however, we were able to get a fully functional project complete and have a successful semester.
