# Atharv's Notebook for ECE 445

# 08/22 - First Class Meeting

Today we had our first meeting in which we learned about conflict management and mathod's of brainstorming. These skills are extremely important for the class as the class is structured to be a group project. Additionally, we the method's of brainstorming section was helpful in learning about how to think of project ideas that we wanted to work on during the semester. 

# 08/24 - Initial Web Board Post

Today I submitted my initial web board post consisting of an initial project to create a tennis speed and spin detector that would be used by tennis players to identify areas of their game that they can improve.

# 08/31 - Project Submission

Today our group met for the first time to brainstorm a potential project we could work on throughout the semester. The idea we came up with was an automatic rotating bookshelf that could store items like books, backpacks, clothes, etc. The shelf would have 4 compartments with 4 LEDs that would turn on where an item has been found. A mobile application will be used to insert and retrieve itmes on the bookshelf. Here is an image of what we propose our shelf will look like:

# 09/01 - Project Design Brainstorming Session

Today we met with our group to identify what components our bookshelf will have. We came up with the following:

- An iPhone application will be used to control the bookshelf's movements by being able to find and retreive items
- An insertion detection system will be created using a photoresistor or QR code to notify the application when an item has been inserted
- An LED will turn on where the item has been found to indicate that the item has been located
- A motor will be used to rotate the bookshelf when commanded by the application
- A wall outlet will be used to power our bookshelf along with the circuit

# 09/05 - Responsibilities Diveded Amongst Team Members

Today we met with our group to identify where each of our skills will be best utilized. The following is a breakdown of how we will distribute our responsibilities:

- Kashyap will oversee the software aspects, including the connection of the application to the ESP32
- Vraj will oversee the PCB design and motor control
- Atharb will oversee mechanical design and help out with PCB related tasks

# 09/12 - First Team Meeting with TA

Today we met with our TA, Nikhil, for the first time to go over our project and determine what components we will use to complete our bookshelf. The following are the main takeaways that came from the meeting:

- An ESP32 with WiFi/Bluetooth capabilities will be used to connect the bookshelf hardware to the application
- The power for our bookshelf and circuit will come from a wall outlet
- A stepper motor will be used to rotate our bookshelf as it is best to control how much the bookshelf will spin rotate when turning. This is an image of what the motor will look like:

# 09/13 - Block Diagram and Visual Aid Finalized

Today we worked on our block diagram which consists of the subsystems and components that will be used to make our project work.

We also created a visual aid to depict what components the project will have, along with how the components will work together to create a complete product.

# 09/14 - Project Proposal Working Session

Today we met with our group to work on the project proposal. These are the main takeaways we had from the meeting:

- The bookshelf will be 4ft tall and 2 ft wide with a cylindrical shape
- Each shelf will have 4 horizontal shelves to separate items further
- A QR code will be used to determine which shelf the user is inputting items to

# 09/15 - Initial Conversation with the Machine Shop

Today we met with the machine shop to go over what we want our bookshelf to look like. Through this conversation, we made a few changes to our design. These are the updates we came up with:

- We are scaling the bookshelf down to be 8in x 8in, and hold electrical components like capacitors and resistors to make it more compact and easier to transfer
- There will be a 10in x 10in x 10in box underneath the shelf to store the PCB, LED, and motor
- We will have holes on the bottom of each shelf that will go directly over the LED to show if/when an item has been found on the shelf
- We also received a stepper motor that will be used for our bookshelf

# 09/16 - CAD Design

After our conversation with the machine shop, we created a CAD design to model what our shelf will look like for the machine shop to use.

# 10/06 - Parts Order Day 1

Today we met to identify what parts we need to order from digikey for our PCB. Unfortunately, we had a lot of questions on where to find things so we had to send an email to Nikhil regarding the questions we had. 

<img width="1424" alt="image" src="https://github.com/KashRama/ECE-445-Lab-Notebook/assets/73131848/c4c35994-1ebf-439c-88c5-ddf9b796cf99">

# 10/08 - Parts Order Day 2

Today we received an email from Nikhil answering the questions we had about how and where to order the parts.

Once we received the email from Nikhil, we identified which parts we needed and where we were able to get each from. We created a spreadsheet with the parts we need, and where we would be able to find those specific parts.

# 10/12 - Submitted CAD Design to Machine Shop

Today we went into the machine sho with the CAD design we had created for what we wanted our bookshelf to look like. Going in with a CAD design was very helpful for them and us as both parties were on the same page regarding what the bookshelf should look like and what the dimensions would be as well. Following the meeting with the machine shop, I sent them an email detailing what we had discussed.

# 10/17 - PCB Order Submitted

Today we submitted our PCB order on PCBWay after designing our circuit and PCB.

# 10/18 - Parts Order

Today we submitted our first parts order off Digikey so we can hopefully get them when the PCB we ordered yesterday arrives. Once we receive both, we plan to begin soldering our PCB.

# 11/01 - Machine Shop Completed Bookshelf

Today we got an email from the machine shop saying that our bookshelf is ready to be picked up. This was exciting for us because it was the first time we were seeing our design come to life. Here is an image of what it looks like:

<img width="196" alt="image" src="https://github.com/KashRama/ECE-445-Lab-Notebook/assets/73131848/987fe382-606d-483e-9313-2fd24c882bc8">

The top compartment had 4 different shelves that can be used to store electrical components. The bottom box has ample space for us to place our circuitry and motor in order to maintain professional packaging. One change we had them made after we saw the bookshelf in real life was adding a stand in the base for the PCB. This was done so that once we had finished our PCB, we'd have a secure spot to place it so that it wouldn't move around and risk breaking.

# 11/03

Today was the first day we went into the lab to start soldering our PCB. We initially started by trying to get our power subsystem soldered on. 

# 11/18 - Final PCB Order Submitted

Today we submitted our final PCB order on our own. This is because our initial design had many small components that were extremely difficult to solder onto our board. We are hopeful that this is the PCB that will end up working as we spent a lot of time into trying to make the previous PCB to work.
